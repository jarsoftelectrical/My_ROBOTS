# My_ROBOTS
Collection of my Robots

A purpose of this repository is to discuss and document properly my Robot designs for Arduino IDE.

## Installation:
How do I setup the Arduino IDE and libraries? or How to install the libraries (not Otto specific) ?
Answer: "There are multiple ways to add libraries to your Arduino IDE after installed the most easy for me is to just Download all the libraries from the files tab for the specific project and move them to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your libraries folder was installed)
Other ways use .zip installation through menu or even automatic updates online(i wish i knew how to do this for Otto) but i never need to do it this way, is a very general topic that all new Arduino users face and there is a lot information by just googling.
